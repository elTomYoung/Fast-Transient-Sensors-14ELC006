Load Voltage Characteristics
Peak Voltage = 492.55kV
Rise Time = 98.44ns
Bandwidth = 3.56MHz

Voltage Sensor
For 2 percent accuracy, requires ratio of 5:1 giving;
Rise Time = 19.69ns
Bandwidth = 17.78MHz

Low Voltage Arm
Chosen design is a coaxial cable with;
Z1 = 50, Z2 = 50, Z = 25
T_{lv} = 0

High Voltage Arm
Using the attenuation factor with a z of 50.00 Ohms gives
 a high voltage arm resistor value of 308 kOhms
with a height of 98.51cm.
For a wire radius of 12microm and a madrel radius of 5.00cm, 
404m of wire is required. This gives a total turns of 642.349551.
Under the discharge from the Marx generator the temeprature
increase in the wire is 79.64degrees
